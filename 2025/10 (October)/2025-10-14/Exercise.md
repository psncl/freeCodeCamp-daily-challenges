# String Count

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2025-10-14

Given two strings, determine how many times the second string appears in the first.

- The pattern string can overlap in the first string. For example, `"aaa"` contains `"aa"` twice. The first two `a`'s and the second two.

## Tests

1. `count('abcdefg', 'def')` should return `1`.
1. `count('hello', 'world')` should return `0`.
1. `count('mississippi', 'iss')` should return `2`.
1. `count('she sells seashells by the seashore', 'sh')` should return `3`.
1. `count('101010101010101010101', '101')` should return `10`.
