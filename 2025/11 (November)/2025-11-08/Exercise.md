# Character Limit

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2025-11-08

In this challenge, you are given a string and need to determine if it fits in a social media post. Return the following strings based on the rules given:

- `"short post"` if it fits within a 40-character limit.
- `"long post"` if it's greater than 40 characters and fits within an 80-character limit.
- `"invalid post"` if it's too long to fit within either limit.

## Tests

1. `can_post("Hello world")` should return `"short post"`.
1. `can_post("This is a longer message but still under eighty characters.")` should return `"long post"`.
1. `can_post("This message is too long to fit into either of the character limits for a social media post.")` should return `"invalid post"`.
