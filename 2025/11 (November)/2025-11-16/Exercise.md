# Rectangle Count

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2025-11-16

Given two positive integers representing the width and height of a rectangle, determine how many rectangles can fit in the given one.

- Only count rectangles with integer width and height.

For example, given `1` and `3`, return `6`. Three 1x1 rectangles, two 1x2 rectangles, and one 1x3 rectangle.

## Tests

1. `count_rectangles(1, 3)` should return `6`.
1. `count_rectangles(3, 2)` should return `18`.
1. `count_rectangles(1, 2)` should return `3`.
1. `count_rectangles(5, 4)` should return `150`.
1. `count_rectangles(11, 19)` should return `12540`.
