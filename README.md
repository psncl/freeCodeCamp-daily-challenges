# Intro

This repository contains my solutions to the [daily coding challanges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/archive) by freeCodeCamp.org.

At the time of writing, I am also going through the fantastic [MIT 6.100L Fall 2022](https://cs.ossu.dev/coursepages/intro-cs/) "Introduction to CS and Programming using Python" course, which is part of the [OSSU Computer Science curriculum](https://cs.ossu.dev/).

### Why are some of the earlier exercises in JavaScript?

When I initially began doing these challenges, JavaScript/TypeScript was the language I worked with everyday on my personal projects. However, I switched to Python soon after to complement the aforementioned MIT 6.100L course. I already knew JavaScript well enough, but not Python, so this was a great excuse to practice Python more.
