# 2026 Winter Games Day 10: Alpine Skiing

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/daily-coding-challenge/2026-02-15

Given a ski hill's vertical drop, horizontal distance, and type, determine the difficulty rating of the hill.

To determine the rating:

- Calculate the steepness of the hill by taking the drop divided by the distance.
- Then, calculate the adjusted steepness based on the hill type:
  - `"Downhill"` multiply steepness by 1.2
  - `"Slalom"`: multiply steepness by 0.9
  - `"Giant Slalom"`: multiply steepness by 1.0

Return:

- `"Green"` if the adjusted steepness is less than or equal to 0.1
- `"Blue"` if the adjusted steepness is greater than 0.1 and less than or equal to 0.25
- `"Black"` if the adjusted steepness is greater than 0.25

## Tests

1. `get_hill_rating(95, 900, "Slalom")` should return `"Green"`.
1. `get_hill_rating(620, 2800, "Downhill")` should return `"Black"`.
1. `get_hill_rating(420, 1680, "Giant Slalom")` should return `"Blue"`.
1. `get_hill_rating(250, 3000, "Downhill")` should return `"Green"`.
1. `get_hill_rating(110, 900, "Slalom")` should return `"Blue"`.
1. `get_hill_rating(380, 1500, "Giant Slalom")` should return `"Black"`.
